## üöÄ Features

* **[Main Geometry]** - [e.g., A low-poly stylized cabin and surrounding environment.]
* **Dynamic Lighting** - Includes [e.g., directional light for the moonlight and a point light simulating fire/lamp glow].
* **[Specific Texture/Material]** - Utilizes [e.g., `MeshStandardMaterial` for realistic shading and PBR textures for the ground.]
* **Interactivity** - Implements `OrbitControls` for full 360-degree camera movement.
* **[Animation Detail]** - [e.g., Procedural movement for stars/clouds or a simple character animation.]
* **Performance Optimized** - Uses a deferred rendering approach and aggressive frustum culling to maintain high framerates.
